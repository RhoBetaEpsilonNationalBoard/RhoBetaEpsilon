To assist both new and established chapters, the National Board maintains a set of template documents for core society activities. These documents are free to all chapters to copy and modify to best suit their goals and needs. 

These templates are designed to be "living" documents - as Rho Beta Epsilon grows, the National Board will continue to update these to best match the overall direction of the society. Below are the current set of templates:

#### Induction Script
More than anything, the goal of inductions is to impress upon new members the honor and responsibility of membership in Rho Beta Epsilon. This script is designed to help with this, while leaving space for each chapter to make their inductions ceremony feel unique and special.

#### Chapter Bylaws
The bylaws lay out each chapters goals -- for promoting engineering and fostering community -- and procedures -- for ensuring fairness during voting and the induction process, tracking membership and finances, and upholding the values of Rho Beta Epsilon. This template helps ensure core tenets of Rho Beta Epsilon are followed from chapter to chapter. Yellow highlights in the text are designed to show the areas requiring changes, though each chapter can (and should) remove, add, or adjust from the overall template as much as they want.

#### Chapter Report
The National Board asks that each chapter submits a report once each semester, updating the Board on that chapter's activity since the last report. This helps make sure each chapter is maintaining a healthy membership, following their bylaws, and doing their best to support their home institution's robotics engineering community. These reports are also a great chance for chapters to ask the National Board for support or advice. To streamline this process, we provide some templates outlining exactly what info we're looking for from each chapter.
