To assist both new and established chapters, the National Board maintains a set of template documents for core society activities. These documents are free to all chapters to copy and modify to best suit their goals and needs. 

These templates are designed to be "living" documents - as Rho Beta Epsilon grows, the National Board will continue to update these to best match the overall direction of the society. Below are the current set of templates:

#### Induction Script
More than anything, the goal of inductions is to impress upon new members the honor and responsibility of membership in Rho Beta Epsilon. This script is designed to help with this, while leaving space for each chapter to make their inductions ceremony feel unique and special.

#### Chapter Bylaws
The bylaws lay out each chapters goals -- for promoting engineering and fostering community -- and procedures -- for ensuring fairness during voting and the induction process, tracking membership and finances, and upholding the values of Rho Beta Epsilon. This template helps ensure core tenets of Rho Beta Epsilon are followed from chapter to chapter. Yellow highlights in the text are designed to show the areas requiring changes, though each chapter can (and should) remove, add, or adjust from the overall template as much as they want.
