The mission of Rho Beta Epsilon is to encourage and recognize exemplary robotics students at the university level while aiding in their personal and professional development, and to advance the robotics engineering community through exceptional education, leadership, and passion for robotics. The Rho Beta Epsilon National Board helps connect chapters and provide oversight to the society, as well as seek out new institutions that are eligible to start PBE chapters.
