                          <h3 id="article-i-name">Article I. Name</h3>
<p>This organization shall be known as Rho Beta Epsilon, The Robotics Engineering Honor Society (hereafter “Rho Beta Epsilon” or the “Society”). Each chapter shall be assigned a Greek letter representing its chronological order of creation. For example, the first chapter shall be assigned the Alpha chapter, and the twenty-fifth shall be assigned the Alpha Alpha chapter. For purposes of concision, Rho Beta Epsilon may be abbreviated as either “⍴βε” or ‘PBE’.</p>
<p>This board will be known as the Rho Beta Epsilon National Board (hereafter the “National Board” or simply the “Board”).</p>
<h3 id="article-ii-purpose">Article II. Purpose</h3>
<p>The organization is organized exclusively for charitable, religious, educational, and scientific purposes under IRC Section 501(c)(3), or corresponding section of any future federal tax code.</p>
<p>The mission of Rho Beta Epsilon is to encourage and recognize exemplary robotics students at the university level while aiding in their personal and professional development, and to advance the robotics engineering community through exceptional education, leadership, and passion for robotics.</p>
<p>The Rho Beta Epsilon National Board is the sole governing body that presides over all Rho Beta Epsilon chapters. The National Board shall provide guidance and support for all chapters and serve as the final moral authority for all Society matters. Additionally, the Board will work to promote Rho Beta Epsilon’s interests at a national level, including leading the creation and growth of new Society chapters.</p>
<p>Upon the dissolution of this organization, assets shall be distributed for one or more exempt purposes within the meaning of IRC Section 501(c)(3), or corresponding section of any future federal tax code, or shall be distributed to the federal government, or to a state or local government, for a public purpose.</p>
<h3 id="article-iii-insignia-of-the-society">Article III. Insignia of the Society</h3>
<h4 id="section-i-emblem">Section I. Emblem</h4>
<p>The emblem of the Society shall be a black cog with a golden ring inset and red within the ring. The center of the gear contains the binary value of seven (”0111”) in gold above a gold five-pin op amp.
These elements symbolize mechanical engineering, computer science, and electrical engineering, respectively, and the heritage of robotics in each of those fields. The number seven in binary represents the seven founding members of the society.</p>
<h4 id="section-ii-colors">Section II. Colors</h4>
<p>The colors of the Society shall be crimson (#A23535), for the passion we exhibit for robotics, gold (#FFDF50), for the standard of quality we strive to achieve, and black (#000000), for the unknown future of robotics.</p>
<h3 id="article-iv-national-board-membership">Article IV. National Board Membership</h3>
<h4 id="section-i-eligibility-for-office">Section I. Eligibility for Office</h4>
<p>Any Alumni Member of any chapter of Rho Beta Epsilon is eligible to run for a seat on the National Board. Collegiate Members in good standing are eligible to run for National Board office if they will obtain Alumni Member status by the beginning of the next National Board Term, as described in Article VI Section II Subsection V.</p>
<h4 id="section-ii-terms-and-elections">Section II. Terms and Elections</h4>
<p>Each National Board officer will serve a term of two years, with terms beginning and ending on May 31 at 11:59 PM EST. Elections for the National Board will occur once every two years. The National Board will announce to the chapters the list of seats up for election by March 1st of each election year, along with an overview of the responsibilities for each seat and the National Board as a whole.</p>
<p>Any eligible member may apply for a seat on the board by submitting a statement of intent to the National Board no later than March 31st at 11:59 PM EST. Statements of intent should not exceed 200 words; candidates may submit one statement of intent for each position they intend to run for. The full list of candidates and their letters of intent will be distributed to the Officer Board of all active chapters by April 7th at 11:59 PM EST. Each chapter will then hold a ranked-choice vote on the candidates for each position using an anonymous electronic form during the next General Body Meeting. In the case that no candidate can be chosen through ranked-choice voting, all remaining candidates will be entered into a head-to-head simple majority vote. Chapters must submit their voting results to the National Board no later than May 1st at 11:59 PM EST.</p>
<p>Once the results of each chapter’s voting have been received, the National Board will tally the votes and announce the results of the election to each chapter no later than May 15th at 11:59 PM EST. If any two candidates are tied after all chapters’ votes have been tallied, the National Board will vote anonymously on the tied candidates.</p>
<h4 id="section-iii-responsibilities">Section III. Responsibilities</h4>
<p>The National Board will consist of at least five officers and shall hold the responsibilities described in this section. Any responsibilities not explicitly defined herein should be considered as below the national level and thus as reserved to each Society chapter. The officer positions and responsibilities of the Board are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The President shall:

<li>Create additional national officer positions as needed, with the voted approval of the National Board and the Chapters of the Society as defined in Article VII</li>
<li>Ensure Rho Beta Epsilon (both the National Board and its chapters) faithfully pursues the purpose established in Article II</li>
<li>Serve as the moral authority of Rho Beta Epsilon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Vice President shall:
<ul>
<li>Replace the President in times of their absence</li>

<li>Maintain records of chapter membership</li>
<li>Manage awards at the national level</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Treasurer shall:

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the officer-specific duties defined above, the National Board shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define the requirements for chapter eligibility, as listed in Article V Section I of this document, and determine if a prospective institution meets these requirements</li>
<li>Approve and decline new chapter applications via the procedure defined in Article V Section II</li>
<li>Notify chapters of their status within Rho Beta Epsilon biannually</li>
<li>Hold a National Board meeting at least once per month</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-iv-removal-from-office">Section IV. Removal From Office</h4>
<p>If a National Board officer feels that another officer has abused their position or been in neglect of their responsibilities, they may privately contact the President and/or Vice President and bring this abuse or neglect to their attention. The contact Board officer will then determine the appropriate next steps, which may include bringing the matter to the attention of the overall Board during any Board meeting. Immediately following this statement, a discussion of the topic must be held at the next National Board meeting that all five Board members attend.</p>
<p>At this meeting, the officer in question will be allowed to make a statement on their behalf, up to five minutes in length, and then must leave the meeting for a discussion held amongst the remaining Board officers. The officer has the ability to waive their right to a statement by stating their intention at the beginning of the proceedings. If the officer does not attend the meeting and does not have an excused absence, the officer automatically forfeits the aforementioned right. After discussion, the Board will hold a vote as outlined in Article VII Section II; this vote must pass unanimously by the four Board members, excluding the member in question.</p>
<p>For any active chapter to initiate the removal process, the chapter must write a letter to the National Board requesting the removal of the National Board officer in question. Upon receipt of such a letter, the President or Vice President must call a vote of the National Board to veto removal, following the procedure in Article VII Section II. The officer in question must abstain from this vote. If this motion does not pass, a vote of the chapters must be called to remove the Board member. This chapter vote will follow the procedure outlined in Article VII Section I.</p>
<p>The National Board will notify each chapter of the results of any vote regarding officer removal at most one week after the vote is held.</p>
<h4 id="section-v-resignation">Section V. Resignation</h4>
<p>A National Board officer may resign their position at any time by submitting written notice to the Board with four weeks&rsquo; notice. The National Board must notify all chapters of this notice at most one week after the written notice is received. Within the four week period, the resigning officer will continue to serve on the Board. During this period, the Board may also begin proceedings to fill the upcoming vacancy following the standard election procedure outlined in Article IV Section VI modified for the current date.</p>
<h4 id="section-vi-board-vacancies">Section VI. Board Vacancies</h4>
<p>If a seat on the National Board becomes vacant, the President assumes the responsibilities of that seat; if the President’s seat becomes vacant, the Vice President assumes the responsibilities of the President. The National Board must seek to fill this spot with an interim officer; any member of the National Board or any Society chapter may nominate someone for this interim position. The interim officer will be elected to the National Board through a vote as outlined in Article IV Section II. Interim National Board officers will serve the remainder of the term formerly being served by the officer who vacated the position in question.</p>
<p>National Board officers who are removed from their position are not eligible to run for office in future elections.</p>
<h3 id="article-v-chapter-eligibility">Article V. Chapter Eligibility</h3>
<h4 id="section-i-eligibility-requirements">Section I. Eligibility Requirements</h4>
<p>Any institution interested in forming a chapter of Rho Beta Epsilon must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The institution must offer an undergraduate or graduate degree in Robotics Engineering or industry accepted equivalent.</li>
<li>The prospective chapter must contain at least six members to fulfill the required officer positions, as defined in Article VI Section III. The founding members must be approved by the Rho Beta Epsilon National Board to ensure that they meet national membership standards.</li>
<li>The prospective chapter must identify a faculty advisor at their institution, following any institutional requirements for student group status.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-ii-forming-a-chapter">Section II. Forming a Chapter</h4>
<p>Prospective chapters must submit a proposed bylaws document to the National Board, as outlined in Article VI Section I Subsection I.</p>
<p>The National Board must approve the formation of all new chapters through a vote as outlined in Article VII Section II. The results of this vote will be conveyed to all existing chapters and the prospective chapter at most one week after the vote is held. If the vote passes, the prospective chapter immediately becomes an active chapter of the Society with all rights, privileges, and responsibilities and is assigned a chapter letter as outlined in Article I.</p>
<p>If the vote does not pass, the National Board will inform the prospective chapter of the key areas missing from their application that led to their denial. The prospective chapter may reapply for active chapter status at any time following the procedure discussed in this section; they must also submit a letter, up to one page in length, outlining the changes made to their submission materials to address the Board’s feedback.</p>
<h3 id="article-vi-chapter-requirements">Article VI. Chapter Requirements</h3>
<h4 id="section-i-general-requirements">Section I. General Requirements</h4>
<h5 id="subsection-i-bylaws">Subsection I. Bylaws</h5>
<p>Each chapter must develop a set of bylaws to govern all of its operations and file these bylaws with the National Board. In the event that this set of bylaws conflicts with the Rho Beta Epsilon National Board Constitution, the National Board Constitution will take precedence. Chapter bylaws may follow the template provided or be wholly developed by the specific chapter, but must expressly define the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The chapter’s specific process for accepting new members</li>
<li>Chapter-specific member requirements to maintain a status of good and active standing</li>
<li>The chapter’s officer positions and their responsibilities</li>
<li>Any documentation required to ensure that the chapter maintains good standing with their host institution</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter bylaws must be consistent with this Constitution and all applicable laws.</p>
<h4 id="subsection-ii-dues">Subsection II. Dues</h4>
<p>All chapters are required to pay dues to the National Board on a semesterly basis. Dues will amount to a fixed percentage of each chapter’s income, equaling 20% of all income earned by that chapter during the preceding semester, including but not limited to income earned through membership dues or events.</p>
<p>The National Board may choose to increase semesterly dues for the upcoming semester at any point in time without a change to this document, so long as the increase does not    exceed 5% total for that academic year. Any increase exceeding this amount in an academic year must be made as an amendment to this document. Increases falling within the threshold must be sent via email to each chapter at least 1 month before the end of the current semester.</p>

<h5 id="subsection-iii-inductions">Subsection III. Inductions</h5>
<p>All chapters are required to conduct at least two inductions each academic year: at least once in the fall semester and at least once in the spring semester. The specific details of the induction process are chosen by each chapter, but must include a reading of the Rho Beta Epsilon Induction Proceedings script or a modified version thereof.</p>
<h5 id="subsection-iv-chapter-reports">Subsection IV. Chapter Reports</h5>
<p>At least once per semester, before a deadline established by the National Board and given to each chapter by at most the fourth week of their respective semester, each chapter is required to provide the National Board with a report of the chapter’s semester activities; a summary of any changes made to the chapter’s bylaws along with a copy of the chapter’s active bylaws; and a membership roster listing member names, year of graduation, degree type, and officer role. They should also provide any photos taken for external marketing purposes, and a summary of any events hosted by the chapter.</p>
<p>Templates for all required above deliverables will be created and maintained by the National Board. Chapters may choose not to use these templates, but any alternative used must encompass the requested information. These templates will be provided to each chapter along with the completion deadline as described above.</p>
<p>Additionally, each chapter must create and maintain an email alias that includes all members of the chapter’s officer board for communication with the National Board. If a chapter uses an alternate method of internal communication such as Slack or Discord, at least one member of the National Board should be included.</p>
<h6 id="subsection-v-chapter-status">Subsection V. Chapter Status</h6>
<p>Any chapter meeting the requirements set forth in Article VI for a given semester is labeled as an active chapter, and has access to all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities listed in this document.  Any chapter that does not meet the requirements set forth by Article VI for a given semester will be moved from active status to probationary status by the National Board and notified accordingly. Probationary chapters may not vote on National Board officer positions or any other motion raised to the National Board.</p>
<p>If a chapter fails to meet the requirements set out in Article VI for three consecutive semesters, they will be moved to inactive status by the National Board and notified accordingly.

When a vote of the chapters is needed on a National Board motion, the Board must notify all active chapters of the details of the motion and the exact results of a vote for and against the motion. Each Collegiate Member in good standing of an active chapter will receive a single vote, unless otherwise stated. The chapter will collect the votes of all such members and inform the National Board of their members’ votes within three weeks from the time the chapter is notified of the motion. Any chapter failing to notify the National Board of their votes will be marked as abstaining from the vote. All motions requiring chapter vote will pass with ⅔ approval of all voting members unless otherwise stated.</p>
<h4 id="section-ii-vote-of-the-national-board">Section II. Vote of the National Board</h4>
<p>Some Chapter activities that may affect other chapters of the Society or affect the National Board’s ability to execute its responsibilities may require a vote of the National Board before taking effect.  A vote of the National Board may be initiated either by a proposed motion from an active chapter or by an internal motion. If initiated by a proposal from an active chapter, the National Board chair will call for a meeting to discuss and vote on the motion within one month from the time the proposal is received; this meeting may coincide with a regular National Board meeting. The motion will pass if approved by a simple majority of the National Board members unless otherwise specified. The National Board must notify all active chapters of the outcome of the vote within one week of the vote.</p>
<h3 id="article-viii-amendments-and-revisions">Article VIII. Amendments and Revisions</h3>

<p>If the changes are approved by the National Board, a vote of each chapter, as outlined in Article VII Section I, will be called to approve the proposed changes. If the amendments are not approved by the National Board, all chapters will be notified of the requested amendments and the reasons why they were not accepted.</p>
<p>The National Board may at any time make changes to correct grammatical or spelling errors, so long as these changes do not in any way materially affect the meaning of the surrounding text. Changes of this type may be made at any time without notifying each Society chapter, though the National Board must vote to confirm any such change.</p>
<h3 id="article-ix-nonprofit-status">Article IX. Nonprofit Status</h3>
<p>As the Board is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, the following requirements must be upheld.</p>
