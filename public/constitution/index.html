<h3 id="article-ix-voting-procedures">Article IX. Voting Procedures</h3>
<h4 id="section-i-vote-of-the-chapters">Section I. Vote of the Chapters</h4>
<p>When a vote of the chapters is needed, the National Board must notify all active chapters of the motion to be voted on.

Any chapter failing to notify the National Board of their votes will be marked as abstaining from the vote.</p>
<p>Officer elections are conducted using the single transferable vote system. All other motions require a two-thirds majority vote of the active chapters to pass.</p>
<h4 id="section-ii-vote-of-the-national-board">Section II. Vote of the National Board</h4>
<p>A vote of the National Board may be initiated either by a proposed motion from an active chapter or by an internal motion. If initiated by a proposal from an active chapter, the National Board chair will call for a meeting to discuss and vote on the motion within one month from the time the proposal is received; this meeting may coincide with a regular National Board meeting. The motion will pass if approved by a simple majority of the National Board members unless otherwise specified. The National Board must notify all active chapters of the outcome of the vote within three weeks of the vote.</p>
